I realize I do a lot of stupid mistakes when it comes to programming in bare C++ which other languages prevent me from doing.
It is super nice writing code where you don't actually screw up or write using AI since at the end of the day you know what you're doing
and you'll be able to explain what is going on too.


It is getting annoyingly verbose since I'm taking forever to draw a stupid triangle ðŸ˜­
